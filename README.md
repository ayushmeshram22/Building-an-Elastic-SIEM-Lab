# SIEM Log Monitoring & Threat Detection

Building an Elastic SIEM Lab
Overview

This project is all about creating a hands-on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab using Elastic SIEM and a Kali Linux VM. The idea is to collect and analyze logs from a system, visualize them on dashboards, and get alerts for specific security events. We’ll generate some sample security events using Nmap scans and forward them to Elastic for monitoring.

This lab is perfect if you want to learn how real-world security monitoring works and how SIEM tools help detect threats.

Tools Used

Oracle VirtualBox – to run our virtual machines

Kali Linux – for generating security events and testing

Elastic Stack – Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic Agent for log collection and analysis

Nmap – to simulate network activity and security events
